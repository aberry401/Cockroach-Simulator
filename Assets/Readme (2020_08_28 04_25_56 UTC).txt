-Credits scene contains just the credits and then back to the main menu

-First Level (Andrew Berry)
Using the up/down arrow keys to move and the left/right arrow keys to rotate, collect as many bread crumbs as you can
without alerting the wandering Robot Kyle to your presence. You can hide in the shadows of the furniture to
avoid being spotted or to stop him from chasing you, and you can see where Kyle is at all times by looking at the minimap. 
You will know you are being chased because Roachy will turn red and an alert sound will play. 
Make it into the room's air vent and continue through to end the level where you will be
given a score based off the number of breadcrumbs you collected and your remaining health.


-Second Level(Noah Johanson)
My level is played by using the up arrow to go forward, down to go back, and left and right to rotate
Avoid the toxic cans and kyle behind you
Traverse the level all the way to the end and you'll see a mouse hole which is the win condition for escaping
